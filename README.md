About Project<br>
This is a web application that you can use to find recipes based on either the ingredients in your
fridge, or maybe you want to find a recipe with a set amount of calories, protein, carbs and fat.
The project is made with React and the data on the recipes are taken from Spoonacular's public API.
I made this app because it solves a problem I have of trying of to out what meals to make that gives me
the right amount of calories and protein I need for building muscle. Also, I usually have 
leftover food in my fridge, so this app stops those ingredients from going to waste.
